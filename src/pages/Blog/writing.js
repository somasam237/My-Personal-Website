        <p> Welcome to my Writings. Here i want to write my thougths, what i learn in the everyday life and experiences that shape my perspective and personality.</p>
        <p> I believe that writing is a powerful tool for self-expression and personal growth. Through writing, I can explore my thoughts and emotions, gain clarity on complex issues, and connect with others who share similar experiences.</p>
        <h1> Atomic Habits</h1>

            <ul>
                <li> The point is to master the habit of showing up!</li> </ul>
                <p> so i read this book called <span>Atomic Habits</span>, a newyork times bestseller by James Clear. I am trying to be a person who always shows up, puts on the effort and do the work that should be done.
                it is not easy for me, because sometimes i feel like i am a person who struggles with consistency and motivation. However, I am committed to making small changes every day to build better habits and become the best version of myself.
                that is what i am commited to do for now on. to work, to learn more, to grow. i want to be obsessed with the process of becoming better.</p>
